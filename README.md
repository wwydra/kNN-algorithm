<h1>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm Implementation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains a Java implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, applied to a breast cancer dataset. The project demonstrates how to classify data points based on their proximity to labeled examples.</p>
<p>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It operates by finding the 'k' training samples closest in distance to a new sample and making predictions based on these neighbors. In this project, the kNN algorithm is applied to a breast cancer dataset to classify tumor samples as malignant or benign.</p>
